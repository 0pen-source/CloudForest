CloudForest is a go/golang implementation of ensembels of decision trees developed at the Institute for Systems Biology. 

Initally it will not include functionality for growing ensembels of trees but will parse ensembels generated by rf-ace (http://code.google.com/p/rf-ace/ which implements Brieman and Cutler's "Random Forest" and other methods) and apply them to feature matrixes (in the AFM format documented in the rf-ace wiki) for the purpose of calculating interesting graphs and statistics related to to a predictor such as a graph representing how often each pair of cases end up on the same leaf of a predictor for a given target. 

The long term goal of CloudForest is abstract the transport of data and paralizable components of Random Forest and related algorythems with go interfaces in a manner that allows parralelization on one or many machines and allows interoprability with optimized implementations in other languages (like rf-ace).
