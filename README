CloudForest implements ensembles of decision trees for machine
learning in pure go (golang). It includes implementations of Breiman and
Cutler's Random Forest for clasiffication and regression on heterogenous
numerical/catagorical data with missing values and several related
algorythems including entropy and cost driven classification, l1
regression and feature selection with artifical contrasts.

Comand line utilities to grow, apply and analize forests are included.

CloudForest is being developed in the Shumelivich Lab at the Institute
for Systems Biology.

Goals

CloudForest is intended to provide fast, comprehensible building blocks
that can be used to implement ensembels of decision trees. CloudForest
is written in idomatic go to allow a data scientist to develop and scale
new models and analysis quickly instead of having to modify complex
legacy code.

Datastructures and file formats are chosen with use in multi threaded
and cluster enviroments in mind.
