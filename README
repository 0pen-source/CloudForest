CloudForest is a go/golang implementation of some utilities for analizng and scaling ensembels of decision trees developed at the Institute for Systems Biology.

It does note yet include functionality for growing ensembels of trees but will parse ensembels generated by rf-ace (http://code.google.com/p/rf-ace/ which implements Brieman and Cutler's "Random Forest" and other methods). 

Some of its outputs may be layed out/visualized with other ISB projects inluding:
https://github.com/ryanbressler/GraphSpectrometer
https://github.com/rbkreisberg/QED

Current Capabilities:
Parse an a predictor forest from rf-ace.
Parse an AFM feature matrix.
Apply a predictor forest to a feature matrix.
Call a closure/function of type Recursable at each node of each tree while doing the above.
Count case-case (leaves) and case-feature (branches) coocurance and output in tsv (the only functionality availible on the comand line)

Road Map:
Refactor into a package and set of comandline utilities/websevices that use the package.
Abstraction of collection data structures to support in memory or from disc/over network computation. 
Iterative/online combination of trees forest to support monitoring/steering of in progress computation.
Growing of Random Forests predictors from data in pure go (for use on app engine etc).
